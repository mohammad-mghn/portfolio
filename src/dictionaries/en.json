    "autobiography": "Mohammad Mohagheghian, a junior web developer, but you can call me Vito. I specialize in front-end development and software engineering in small cases. I thoroughly enjoy utilizing my skills to contribute to technological advancements and transform ideas into reality. My programming journey began during high school when I got introduced to Python. I grasped the basics of programming and found joy in creating various projects without limitations. However, I encountered a challenge. I constantly desired my applications to boast a captivating UI. Using basic GUI libraries with numerous styling issues hindered my creativity. As a result, I transitioned into front-end development and JavaScript. The deeper I delved into front-end development, the more my affection for programming grew. I also developed a keen interest in startup ecosystems. Presently, I reside in my hometown, Isfahan, Iran. These days, I am accumulating experiences and acquiring new skills. My goal is to implement ideas just only limited by my imagination. Feel free to explore my skills, projects, and also the experiences of others who have collaborated with me.",
